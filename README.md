# Data Visualization - Ford GoBike (Bike Shares)

## by Satish Nawal


## Dataset

The dataset, 201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv, is downloaded from Ford GoBike and licensed by Ford GoBike. This dataset includes 183412 trips with multiple features such as locations, time, and user attributes. I have changed few data types and removed couple of columns, also created a seperate data set for just top 5 most visited stations to have special focus on highly used stations for the Rides. Station location has also been shared.


## Summary of Findings

Univariate Exploration: I tried to explored the different distribution of the data sets. Average Rides duration was captured which isn't a huge number and lies b/w 4-6 minutes in general, also the location of start station and end station doesn't show much difference which suggests that Rides are of shorter duration. There are significantly more subscribers using the bike rides than the members which might suggest costing difference but can't be confirmed with given data sets attributes.


Bivariate Exploration: I also categorised the data frame by Top5 stations based on most visited start stations to give more insight on highly used locations. Visual shows that Montgomery and san francisco stations shows longest ride duration in most used stations.Male Riders data shows ride duration greater than of the female riders. Most of the rides are used by Younder generation (20-35 age group).Age and duration of trips are slightly negative-correlated

Multivariate Exploration: From the data sets seperating few aspects like user types, customers and subscribers, gives more insights.  Moreover, customers ride longer than subscribers. For top 5 stations, These visuals also confirm that Customers are using the rides for londer duration and with older age the duration is decreasing.


## Key Insights for Presentation

The stations with the most trips are located in San Francisco and Montgomery which shows that people might be using the rides to go to certain places daily may be connecting rail or bus terminal etc. Subscribers and customers uses the rides in different numbers which might directs towards different pricing model b/w the two groups. 
Company might focus to advertise more on the younger generation people as they heavily used the rides and might think about any alternative ride offer for elders because data suggests bike rides are not the one they favour.
